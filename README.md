# Customer-Classification-
The basis of the project is to classify the customer data on the basis of cluster data that the ecommerce can take on the basis of data. This will allow the businesses to customize services and products for the segment.

In this project, cross validation and ensemble learning methods were used and are compared with each other to know which model is the best that can be taken by the e commerce.
